# Release notes

## Cloud App Security release 99
Released June 18, 2017

**New Features**

-	You can now require users to sign in again to all Office 365 and Azure AD apps as a quick and effective remediation for suspicious user activity alerts and compromised accounts. You can find the new governance in the policy settings and the alert pages, next to the Suspend user option.
- Security extensions are now available for Cloud App Security under **Settings**. Security Extensions include the following sections:
  -	[API tokens](api-tokens.md) – generate and manage your own API tokens to integrate Cloud App Security with third-party software
  - [SIEM agents](siem.md) - You can now integrate Cloud App Security with your SIEM server to enable centralized monitoring of alerts and activities. Integrating with a SIEM service allows you to better protect your cloud applications while maintaining your usual security workflow, automating security procedures and correlating between cloud-based and on-premises events. The Cloud App Security SIEM agent runs on your server and pulls alerts and activities from Cloud App Security and streams them into the SIEM server.
  - [External DLP - Preview](icap-stunnel.md) – Cloud App Security allows you to leverage existing investments in third-party classification systems such as Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions, and enables you to scan the contents of cloud applications using existing deployments running in your environment. Contact your account manager to join the preview.
-	You can now filter for **Add impersonation role assignment** activities in the Activity log. This activity enables you to detect when an admin has granted an **Application Impersonation** role to any user or system account, using the cmdlet **New-ManagementRoleAssignment**. This role allows the impersonator to perform operations by using the permissions associated with the impersonated account, instead of the permissions associated with the impersonator’s account.
Cloud Discovery Improvements:
-	Cloud Discovery data can now be enriched with Azure Active Directory username data. When you enable this feature, the username received in the discovery traffic logs will be matched and replaced by the Azure AD username enabling the following new features:
  -	You can investigate Shadow IT usage by Azure Active Directory user.
  -	You can correlate the discovered cloud app use with the API collected activities.
  -	You can then create custom logs based on Azure AD user groups. For example, a Shadow IT report for a specific Marketing department.
-	Improvements were made to the Juniper syslog parser. It now supports the welf and sd-syslog formats.
-	Improvements were made to the Palo Alto parser for better application discovery.
-	To verify that logs are being successfully uploaded, you can now see the status of your log collectors in the Cloud App Security portal. 
General improvements:
-	Built-in IP address tags and custom IP tags are now considered hierarchically, with custom IP tags taking precedence over built-in IP tags. For instance, if an IP address is tagged as **Risky** based on threat intelligence, but there is a custom IP tag that identifies it as **Corporate** the custom category and tags will take precedence.


## Cloud App Security release 98 
Released June 4, 2017
 
Cloud Discovery updates:
-	Users can now perform advanced filtering on discovered apps, to enable you to perform deep investigation such as filtering apps based on usage - how much upload traffic from discovered apps of certain types, how many users used certain categories of discovered apps. You can also perform multi-selection in the left panel to select multiple categories. 
-	Started roll out of new templates for Cloud Discovery which are based on popular searches, for example "non-compliant cloud storage app". These basic filters can be used as templates to perform analysis on your discovered apps.
-	For ease of use, you can now perform actions such as sanction and unsanction across multiple apps in one action.
-	We are now rolling out the ability to create custom discovery reports based on Azure Active Directory user groups. For example, if you want to see the cloud use of your marketing department, you can import the marketing group using the import user group feature, and then create a custom report for this group.

New features:
-	RBAC for Security Readers completed roll out. This feature enables you to manage the permissions you grant to your admins inside the Cloud App Security console. By default, all Azure Active Directory and Office 365 Global admins and Security admins have full permissions in the portal, and all Security readers in Azure Active Directory and Office 365 have read-only access in Cloud App Security. You can add additional admins or override permissions using the “Manage Access” option. For more information see [Managing admin permissions](manage-admins.md).
-	Detailed threat intelligence reports are now available for risky IP addresses detected by Microsoft intelligent security graph: when an activity is performed by a botnet, you will see the name of the botnet (if available) with a link to a detailed report about the specific botnet.
 
## Cloud App Security release 97
Released May 24, 2017

### New features
-	Investigate files and policy violations: You can now see all policy matches in the Files page. In addition, you the File Alert page has been improved to now include a separate tab for History of the specific file enabling you to drill down into the violation history across all policies for the specific file. Every History event includes a snapshot of the file at the time of the alert. It will include an indication of whether the file was deleted or quarantined.
-	[Admin quarantine](use-case-admin-quarantine.md) is now available for Office 365 SharePoint and OneDrive for Business files, in private preview. This feature enables you to quarantine files that match policies, or set an automated action to quarantine them, removing them from the user’s SharePoint directory and copying the original file to the admin quarantine location of your choice.
        
### Cloud Discovery improvements

-	Cloud Discovery support for Cisco Meraki logs has been improved.
-	The option to suggest an improvement to Cloud Discovery now enables you to suggest new risk factor.
-	The custom log parser was improved to support log formats by separating the setting of time and date and to give you the option to set timestamp.
-	Starting to roll out the ability to create custom discovery reports based on Azure Active Directory user groups. For example, if you want to see the cloud use of your marketing department, you can import the marketing group using the import user group feature, and then create a custom report for this group.
Other updates
-	Cloud App Security now includes support for the Microsoft Power BI activities that are supported in the Office 365 audit log. This feature is being rolled out gradually. Note that you need to enable [this functionality in the Power BI portal](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/documentation/powerbi-admin-auditing/).
-	In activity policies, you can now set notify and suspend actions to be taken on the user across all connected apps. For example, you can set a policy to always notify the user's manager and suspend the user immediately whenever the user has multiple failed logins in any connected app.
 
## OOB release
-	In a speedy reaction to the ransomware sweeping the globe, on Sunday, the Cloud App Security team added a new [Potential ransomware activity detection policy](use-case-ransomware.md) template to the portal that includes the signature extension of WannaCrypt. We advise you to the set this policy today.

## Cloud App Security release 96
Released May 8, 2017

New features:

-	Continuing the gradual roll out of the Security Reader permission which enables you to manage the permissions you grant to your admins inside the Cloud App Security console. By default, all Azure Active Directory and Office 365 Global admins and Security admins have full permissions in the portal, and all Security readers in Azure Active Directory and Office 365 will have read-only access in Cloud App Security. For more information see [Managing admin permissions](manage-admins.md).
-	Completed roll out of Cloud Discovery support for user-defined log parsers for CSV-based logs. Cloud App Security enables you to configure a parser for your previously unsupported appliances by providing you with the tools to delineate which columns correlate to specific data. For more information see [Custom log parser](custom-log-parser.md).

Improvements:

-	Cloud Discovery now supports Juniper SSG appliances.
-	Cloud Discovery support for Cisco ASA logs has been improved for better visibility.
-	You can now more easily run bulk actions and select multiple records in Cloud App Security portal tables: the page length has been increased to improve bulk operations.
-	The **Outbound sharing by domain**, and **Owners of shared files** built-in reports can now be run for Salesforce data.
-	We are starting rollout of additional Salesforce activities enabling you to track interesting information that was extracted from the activity data. These activities include viewing and editing accounts, leads, opportunities and various other interesting Salesforce objects.
-	New activities were added for Exchange to enable you to monitor which permissions were granted for user mailboxes or mailbox folders. These activities include:
    -	Add recipient permissions
    -	Remove recipient permissions
    -	Add mailbox folder permissions
    -	Remove mailbox folder permissions
    -	Set mailbox folder permissions

    For example, you can now monitor users who were granted **SendAs** permissions to other users’ mailboxes and as a result can now send emails in their name.


## Cloud App Security release 95
Released April 24, 2017

**Updates**
- The **Accounts** page has been updated with improvements that make detecting risks easier. You can now more easily filter for internal and external accounts, see at a glance whether a user has admin permissions and you can perform actions on each account per-app simply (such as remove permissions, remove user’s collaborations, suspend user). In addition, imported [user groups](user-groups.md) for each account will be displayed. 

- For Microsoft work accounts (Office 365 and Azure Active Directory), Cloud App Security groups different user identifiers such as proxy addresses, aliases, SID and more under a single account. All aliases related to an account will appear under the primary email address. Based on the list of user identifiers, for activities whose actor is a user identifier, the actor will be displayed as the primary user name UPN (User Principal Name). Based on the UPN, groups will be assigned and policies applied. This will improve investigation of activities and fuse all related activities to the same session for anomalies and group based policies. This feature will be gradually rolled out over the next month.

- The Robot tag was added as a possible risk factor in the Browser Use built-in report. Now, in addition to browser use being tagged as outdated, you can see when browser use was performed by a robot. Learn more about the [built-in reports](built-in-report-reference.md).

- When creating a content inspection file policy, you can now set the filter to include only files with at least 50 matches.



## Cloud App Security release 94
Released April 2, 2017

**New features:**
-	Cloud App Security is now integrated with Azure RMS. You can protect files in Office 365 OneDrive and Sharepoint Online with Microsoft Rights Management directly from the Cloud App Security portal. This can be accomplished from the **Files** page. For more information see [Integrating with Azure Information Protection](azip-integration.md). Support for additional applications will be available in future versions.
-	Up until now, when robot and crawler activities take place on your network, it was especially hard to identify because the activities are not performed by a user on your network. Without your knowledge, bots and crawlers can run malicious tools on your computers. Now, Cloud App Security gives you the tools to see when robots and crawlers are performing activities on your network. You can use the new user agent tag to filter activities in the activity log. The user agent tag enables you to filter all activities performed by robots and you can use it to create a policy that alerts you each time this type of activity is detected. You will be updated when future releases will include this risky activity as embedded into the anomaly detection alerts. 
-	The new unified app permissions page enables you to more easily investigate the permissions your users have given to third party apps. By clicking on **Investigate** > **App permissions**, you can now view a list of all the permissions your users gave to third-party apps with a page of app permissions per connected app that enables you to better compare between the various apps and the permissions granted.  For more information, see [Manage app permissions](manage-app-permissions.md).
-	You can filter data right from the table drawer for easier investigation.
In the **Activity log**, the **Files** table and **App permissions** pages are now enhanced with new contextual actions that makes pivoting in the investigation process a lot easier. We also added quick links to configuration pages and the ability to copy data with a single click. For more information see the information about [working with the file and activity drawers](file-filters.md).
-	Support for Microsoft Teams to Office 365 Activity logs and alerts roll out was completed.
 



## Cloud App Security release 93
Released March 20, 2017

**New features:**
-   You can now apply policies to include or exclude imported user groups. 
-	Cloud App Security Anonymization now enables you to configure a custom encryption key. For more information, see [Cloud Discovery anonymization](cloud-discovery-anonymizer.md).
-	In order to have more control over user and account management, you now have direct access to Azure AD account settings for each user and account from within the **Account** page by clicking the cog next to each user. This enables easier access to advanced user management features group management, configuration of MFA, details about user sign-ins and the ability to block sign-in. 
-	You can now export a blocking script for unsanctioned apps via the Cloud App Security API. Read more about our APIs in the Cloud App Security portal by clicking the question mark in the menu bar, followed by **API documentation**.
-	The Cloud App Security app connector for ServiceNow was expanded to include support for OAuth tokens (as introduced in Geneva, Helsinki, Istanbul). This provides a more robust API connection to ServiceNow which does not rely on the deploying user. For more information see [Connect ServiceNow to Microsoft Cloud App Security](connect-servicenow-to-microsoft-cloud-app-security.md). Existing customers can update their settings in the ServiceNow App connector page.
-	If you configured additional third-party DLP scanners, DLP scan status will now show the status of each connector independently to improve visibility.
-	Cloud App Security now includes support for the Microsoft Teams activities that are supported in the Office 365 audit log. This feature is being rolled out gradually.
-	For Exchange Online impersonation events, you can now filter by the permission level used - delegated, admin or delegated admin. You can search for events displaying the impersonation level that interests you in the **Activity log** by searching for **Activity objects** > **Item**.
-	In the app drawer on the App Permissions tab you can now see the **Publisher** of each app. You can also use the Publisher as a filter for investigation of additional apps from the same publisher.
-	Risky IP addresses now show up as an independent risk factor rather than weighted under the general **Location** risk factor. 
-	When Azure Information Protection labels are disabled on a file, the disabled labels will appear as disabled in Cloud App Security. Deleted labels will not be displayed.
 
**Additional Salesforce support:**
-	You can now suspend and unsuspend Salesforce users in Cloud App Security. This can be accomplished in the **Accounts** tab of the Salesforce Connector by clicking the cog at the end of the row of a specific user, and selecting **Suspend** or **Unsuspend** and can also be applied as a governance action as part of a policy. All suspend and unsuspend activities taken in Cloud App Security will be logged in the [Governance log](governance-actions.md). 
-	Improved visibility to Salesforce content sharing: You can now see which files were shared with whom, including publicly shared files, files shared with groups and files shared with the entire Salesforce domain. Improved visibility will be rolled out retroactively to new and current connected Salesforce apps, it may take a while for this to update the first time.
-	We improved coverage for the following Salesforce events, and separated them out of the **Manage users** activity: 
    - Edit permissions
    - Create user
    - Change role
    - Reset password
