## Updates made in 2017

### Cloud App Security release 113

Released December 25, 2017

- We're excited to announce that Cloud App Security now supports deepened integration with Azure Information Protection. This public preview feature enables you to scan and classify files in cloud apps, and automatically apply Azure Information protection labels for protection. This feature is available for Box, SharePoint, and OneDrive. For more information, see [Azure Information Protection integration](azip-integration.md).

- Cloud Discovery log parsers now support for generic formats: LEEF, CEF, and W3C.

### Cloud App Security release 112

Released December 10, 2017

- You can now access the relevant insight drawer by clicking on a username or IP address in the Activity log.
- When investigating activities, you can now easily view all activities within the same time period from within the insight drawer by clicking on the clock icon. The clock icon enables you to view all activities done within 48 hours of the activity you're viewing.
- Improvements were made to the Cloud Discovery log parser for Juniper SRX.
- For activities monitored by the proxy, the **Activity object** was expanded to include information relevant to DLP scans. Matched policies were expanded to include DLP violations if they exist.

### Cloud App Security release 111

Released November 26, 2017

- Discovery policies now support app tags as a condition and as a governance action. This addition enables you to automatically tag newly discovered apps with custom tags such as **Trending apps**. You can also use the app tag as a filter. For example, “Alert me when an app in the ‘Watchlist’ has more than 100 users in a single day”.

- The **Time** filter was improved to make it more user-friendly.

- Content inspection now enables you to distinguish between content, metadata, and filename, enabling you to select which you want to inspect.

- A new governance action was added for G Suite. You can now **Reduce public access** to shared files. This action enables you to set publicly available files to be available only with a shared link.

- All OKTA logon activities to other applications will now show up in Cloud App Security as originating from OKTA. You can view and filter based on the target application to which the login was performed in the activity’s **Activity objects** field.

### Cloud App Security release 110

Released November 12, 2017

- Now generally available: We're starting to roll out a new deployment mode for the log collector. In addition to the current virtual-appliance based deployment, the new Docker (container) based log collector can be installed as a package on [Ubuntu machines](discovery-docker.md) both on-premises and in Azure. When using the Docker, the hosting machine is owned by the customer, who can freely patch and monitor it.

- Using the new blue question mark in the corner, you can now access the relevant Cloud App Security documentation page on docs.microsoft.com from within the pages of the portal. Each link is context-sensitive, taking you to the information you need based on the page you’re on.
- You can now send feedback from every page of the Cloud App Security portal. Feedback enables you to report bugs, request new features and share your experience directly with the Cloud App Security team.
- Improvements were made to the Cloud discovery ability to recognize subdomains for deep-dive investigations into your organization’s cloud usage. For more information, see [Working with discovered apps](discovered-apps.md).

### Cloud App Security release 109

Released October 29, 2017

- Microsoft Cloud App Security proxy feature rollout has started. The Microsoft Cloud App Security proxy gives you the tools you need to have real-time visibility and control over access to your cloud environment, and activities within it. For example:

  - Avoid data leaks by blocking downloads before they happen.
  - Set rules that force data stored in and downloaded from the cloud to be protected with encryption.
  - Gain visibility into unprotected endpoints so you can monitor what's being done on unmanaged devices.
  - Control access from non-corporate networks or risky IP addresses.

  For more information, see [Protect apps with Conditional Access App Control](proxy-intro-aad.md).

- We're gradually rolling out the ability to filter according to specific service activity names. This new Activity Type filter is more granular, to enable you to monitor specific app activities, as opposed to more general activity types. For example, previously, you could filter for the **Run command**, and now you can filter for specific EXO cmdlets. The activity name can also be seen in the Activity drawer under **Type (in app)**. This capability will eventually replace the Activity type filter.

- Cloud discovery now supports Cisco ASA with FirePOWER.

- Performance enhancements were made to the Discovery User and IP pages to improve user experience.

### Cloud App Security releases 105, 106, 107, 108

Released September/October 2017

- Cloud App Security now includes a data center located in the EU. In addition to our US data center, the EU data center will enable Cloud App Security customers to be in complete compliance with new and upcoming European standardization and certifications.
- New filters were added to the **App connectors** page that provide you with simpler filtering and additional insight.
- Cloud discovery on log files that have only destination IP information was improved.

### Cloud App Security release 104

Released August 27, 2017

- You can now add IP ranges in bulk by creating a script using the **IP address ranges API**. The API can be found from the Cloud App Security portal menu bar by clicking the question mark and then **API documentation**.
- Cloud Discovery now provides better visibility for blocked transactions, by presenting both the total transactions as well as the blocked transactions.
- You can now filter cloud applications based on whether they're certified with **ISO 27017**. This new Cloud App Catalog risk factor determines whether the application provider has this certification. ISO 27017 establishes commonly accepted controls and guidelines for processing and protecting user information in a public cloud computing environment.
- To enable you to prepare for GDPR compliance, we gathered the GDPR readiness statements from the cloud apps in the Cloud App Catalog. It doesn’t yet affect the app risk score, but provides a link for you to the app publisher’s GDPR readiness page, when provided. Microsoft hasn't verified this content and isn't responsible for its validity.

### Cloud App Security release 103

Released August 13, 2017

- Cloud App Security added Azure Information Protection native protection support for the following Office files .docm, .docx, .dotm, .dotx, .xlam, .xlsb, .xlsm, .xlsx, .xltx, .xps, .potm, .potx, .ppsx, .ppsm, .pptm, .pptx, .thmx, .vsdx, .vsdm, .vssx, .vssm, .vstx, .vstm (in place of generic protection).

- Any Azure Active Directory Compliance administrator will automatically be granted similar permissions in Cloud App Security. Permissions include the ability to read only and manage alerts, create and modify file policies, allow file governance actions, and view all the built-in reports under Data Management.

- We extended the DLP violation context from 40 to 100 characters to help you better understand the context of the violation.

- Detailed error messages to the Cloud Discovery Custom Log uploader to enable you to easily troubleshoot errors in log upload.

- The Cloud Discovery block script was extended to support Zscaler format.

- New Cloud App Catalog risk factor: data retention after account termination. This enables you to make sure that your data is completely removed after you terminate an account within a cloud app.

### Cloud App Security release 102

Released July 30, 2017

- Because IP address information is crucial for almost all investigations, you can now view detailed information about IP addresses in the Activity Drawer. From within a specific activity, you can now click on the IP address tab to view consolidated data about the IP address. The data includes the number of open alerts for the specific IP address, a trend graph of recent activity and a location map. This feature enables easy drill down. For example, when investigating impossible travel alerts, you can easily understand where the IP address was used and if it was involved in suspicious activities or not. You can perform actions directly in the IP address drawer that enable you to tag an IP address as risky, VPN, or corporate to ease future investigation and policy creation. For more information, see [IP address insights](activity-filters.md#ip-address-insights)

- In Cloud Discovery, you can now use [custom log formats](custom-log-parser.md)  for [automated log uploads](discovery-docker.md). Custom log formats enable you to easily automate log upload from your SIEMs such as Splunk servers or any other unsupported format.

- The new user investigation actions enable an added level of drill-down to user investigations. From the **Investigation** pages, you can now right-click on an activity, user, or account and apply one of the following new filters for advanced investigation and filtration: **View related activity**, **View related governance**, **View related alerts**, **View owned files**, **View files shared with this user**.

- The Cloud App Catalog now contains a new field for data retention after account termination. This risk factor enables you to make sure that your data is completely removed after you terminate an account within a cloud app.

- Cloud App Security now has enhanced visibility into activities regarding Salesforce objects. Objects include leads, accounts, campaigns, opportunities, profiles, and cases. For example, visibility into access of account pages enables you to configure a policy that alert you if a user views an unusually large number of account pages. This is available through the Salesforce App Connector, when you have enabled Salesforce Event Monitoring in Salesforce (part of Salesforce Shield).

- Do not track is now available for private preview customers! You can now control which users’ activity data is processed. This feature enables you to set specific groups in Cloud App Security as “Do not track”. For example, you can now decide not to process any activity data for users located in Germany or any country that is not bound by a specific compliance law. This can be implemented across all apps in Cloud App Security, for a specific app, or even for a specific subapp. Additionally, this feature can be used to facilitate gradual roll out of Cloud App Security. For more information or to join the private preview for this feature, contact support or your account representative.

### Cloud App Security release 100

Released July 3, 2017

**New features**

- **Security extensions:** Security extensions is a new dashboard for centralized management of all security extensions to Cloud App Security.  Extensions include API token management, SIEM agents, and External DLP connectors. The new dashboard is available in Cloud App Security under “Settings”.

  - API tokens – generate and manage your own [API tokens](api-tokens.md)  to integrate Cloud App Security with third-party software using our RESTful APIs.
  - SIEM agents – [SIEM integration](siem.md) was previously located directly under “Settings”, now available as a tab in Security Extensions.
  - External DLP (Preview) – Cloud App Security allows you to [leverage existing investments in third-party classification systems](icap-stunnel.md) such as Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions, and enables you to scan the contents of cloud applications using existing deployments running in your environment. Contact your account manager to join the preview.

- **Automatically sanction/unsanction:** New App detection policies give Cloud Discovery the ability to automatically set apps with Sanctioned/Unsanctioned label. This gives you the ability to automatically identify apps that are in violation of your organization’s policy and regulations and add them to the generated blocking script.
- **Cloud App Security file labels:** You can now apply Cloud App Security file labels to now provide more insight into the files it scans. For each file scanned by Cloud App Security DLP, you can now know if the files were blocked from being inspected because they were encrypted or corrupted. For instance, you can set up policies to alert and quarantine password protected files that are shared externally. This feature is available for files scanned after July 3, 2017.

    You can filter for these files by using the filter **Classification labels** > **Cloud App Security**:

  - **Azure RMS encrypted** – files whose content wasn't inspected because they have Azure RMS encryption set.
  - **Password encrypted** – files whose content wasn't inspected because they're password protected by the user.
  - **Corrupt file** – files whose content wasn't inspected because their content couldn't be read.

- **User insights**: The investigation experience was upgraded to enable out-of-the-box insights about the acting user. With a single click, you can now see a comprehensive overview of the users from the Activity drawer, Insights include which location they connected from, how many open alerts are they're involved with, and their metadata information.
- **App connector insights:** Under **App Connectors**, each connected app now includes an app drawer in the table for easier drill-down into its status. Details that are provided include when the App connector was connected and last health check on the connector. You can also monitor the status of DLP scanning on each app: the total number of files inspected by DLP and the status of the real-time scans (requested scans vs. actual scans). You'll be able to tell if the rate of files scanned by Cloud App Security in real time is lower than the requested number, and whether your tenant might be exceeding its capacity and experiencing a delay in the DLP results.

- **Cloud App Catalog customization:**

  - **App tags**: You can now create custom tags for apps. These tags can be used as filters for diving deeper into specific types of apps that you want to investigate. For example, custom watch list, assignment to a specific business unit, or custom approvals, such as “approved by legal”.
  - **Custom notes**: As you review and assess the different applications that were discovered across your environment, you can now save your conclusions and insights in the Notes.
  - **Custom risk score**: You can now override the risk score of an app. For example, if the risk score of an app is 8 and it's a sanctioned app in your organization, you can change the risk score to 10 for your organization. You can also add notes to make the justification of the change clear when anyone reviews the app.

- **New log collector deployment mode:** We're starting to roll out a new deployment mode is now available for the log collector. In addition to the current virtual-appliance based deployment, the new Docker (container) based log collector can be installed as a package on Windows and Ubuntu machines both on-premises and in Azure. When using the Docker, the hosting machine is owned by the customer, who can freely patch and monitor it.

**Announcements:**

- The Cloud App Catalog now supports over 15,000 discoverable apps
- Compliance: Cloud App Security is officially SOC1/2/3 certified by Azure. For the full list of certifications, see [Compliance offerings](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/compliance/complianceofferings) and filter the results for Cloud App Security.

**Other improvements:**

- **Improved parsing:** Improvements were made in the Cloud Discovery log parsing mechanism. Internal errors are significantly less likely to occur.
- **Expected log formats:** The expected log format for Cloud Discovery logs now provides examples for both Syslog format and FTP format.
- **Log collector upload status:** You can now see the log collector status in the portal and troubleshoot errors faster using the in-portal status notifications and the system alerts.

### Cloud App Security release 99

Released June 18, 2017

**New Features**

- You can now require users to sign in again to all Office 365 and Azure AD apps. Require sign in again as a quick and effective remediation for suspicious user activity alerts and compromised accounts. You can find the new governance in the policy settings and the alert pages, next to the Suspend user option.
- You can now filter for **Add impersonation role assignment** activities in the Activity log. This activity enables you to detect when an admin has granted an **Application Impersonation** role to any user or system account, using the cmdlet **New-ManagementRoleAssignment**. This role allows the impersonator to perform operations by using the permissions associated with the impersonated account, instead of the permissions associated with the impersonator’s account.

**Cloud Discovery Improvements:**

- Cloud Discovery data can now be enriched with Azure Active Directory username data. When you enable this feature, the username received in the discovery traffic logs will be matched and replaced by the Azure AD username. Enriching enables the following new features:
  - You can investigate Shadow IT usage by Azure Active Directory user.
  - You can correlate the discovered cloud app use with the API collected activities.
  - You can then create custom logs based on Azure AD user groups. For example, a Shadow IT report for a specific Marketing department.
- Improvements were made to the Juniper syslog parser. It now supports the welf and sd-syslog formats.
- Improvements were made to the Palo Alto parser for better application discovery.
- To verify that logs are being successfully uploaded, you can now see the status of your log collectors in the Cloud App Security portal.

**General improvements:**

- Built-in IP address tags and custom IP tags are now considered hierarchically, with custom IP tags taking precedence over built-in IP tags. For instance, if an IP address is tagged as **Risky** based on threat intelligence, but there's a custom IP tag that identifies it as **Corporate**, the custom category and tags will take precedence.

### Cloud App Security release 98

Released June 4, 2017

**Cloud Discovery updates:**

- Users can now perform advanced filtering on discovered apps. Filtering enables you to perform deep investigation. For example, filtering apps based on usage. Wow much upload traffic from discovered apps of certain types? How many users used certain categories of discovered apps? You can also perform multi-selection in the left panel to select multiple categories.
- Started roll out of new templates for Cloud Discovery that are based on popular searches such as "non-compliant cloud storage app". These basic filters can be used as templates to perform analysis on your discovered apps.
- For ease of use, you can now do actions such as sanction and unsanction across multiple apps in one action.
- We're now rolling out the ability to create custom discovery reports based on Azure Active Directory user groups. For example, if you want to see the cloud use of your marketing department, you can import the marketing group using the import user group feature, then create a custom report for this group.

**New features:**

- RBAC for Security Readers completed roll out. This feature enables you to manage the permissions you grant to your admins inside the Cloud App Security console. By default, all Azure Active Directory admins, Office 365 Global admins, and Security admins have full permissions in the portal. All Security readers in Azure Active Directory and Office 365 have read-only access in Cloud App Security. You can add additional admins or override permissions using the “Manage Access” option. For more information, see [Managing admin permissions](manage-admins.md).
- We're now rolling out detailed threat intelligence reports for risky IP addresses detected by Microsoft intelligent security graph. When an activity is performed by a botnet, you'll see the name of the botnet (if available) with a link to a detailed report about the specific botnet.

### Cloud App Security release 97

Released May 24, 2017

**New features:**

- Investigate files and policy violations: You can now see all policy matches in the Files page. Additionally, the File Alert page has been improved to now include a separate tab for History of the specific file. The improvement enables you to drill down into the violation history across all policies for the specific file. Every History event includes a snapshot of the file at the time of the alert. It will include an indication of whether the file was deleted or quarantined.
- [Admin quarantine](use-case-admin-quarantine.md) is now available in private preview for Office 365 SharePoint and OneDrive for Business files. This feature enables you to quarantine files that match policies or set an automated action to quarantine them. Quarantining removes the files from the user’s SharePoint directory and copies the originals to the admin quarantine location you choose.

**Cloud Discovery improvements:**

- Cloud Discovery support for Cisco Meraki logs has been improved.
- The option to suggest an improvement to Cloud Discovery now enables you to suggest new risk factor.
- The custom log parser was improved to support log formats by separating the setting of time and date and to give you the option to set timestamp.
- Starting to roll out the ability to create custom discovery reports based on Azure Active Directory user groups. For example, if you want to see the cloud use of your marketing department, import the marketing group using the import user group feature, and then create a custom report for this group.

**Other updates:**

- Cloud App Security now includes support for the Microsoft Power BI activities that are supported in the Office 365 audit log. This feature is being rolled out gradually. You need to enable [this functionality in the Power BI portal](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/documentation/powerbi-admin-auditing/).
- In activity policies, you can now set notify and suspend actions to be taken on the user across all connected apps. For example, you can set a policy to always notify the user's manager and suspend the user immediately whenever the user has multiple failed logins in any connected app.

### OOB release

- In a speedy reaction to the ransomware sweeping the globe, on Sunday, the Cloud App Security team added a new [Potential ransomware activity detection policy](use-case-ransomware.md) template to the portal that includes the signature extension of WannaCrypt. We advise you to the set this policy today.

### Cloud App Security release 96

Released May 8, 2017

**New features:**

- Continuing the gradual roll out of the Security Reader permission, which enables you to manage the permissions you grant to your admins inside the Cloud App Security console. By default, all Azure Active Directory and Office 365 Global admins and Security admins have full permissions in the portal. All Security readers in Azure Active Directory and Office 365 will have read-only access in Cloud App Security. For more information, see [Managing admin permissions](manage-admins.md).
- Completed roll out of Cloud Discovery support for user-defined log parsers for CSV-based logs. Cloud App Security enables you to configure a parser for your previously unsupported appliances by providing you with the tools to delineate which columns correlate to specific data. For more information, see [Custom log parser](custom-log-parser.md).

**Improvements:**

- Cloud Discovery now supports Juniper SSG appliances.
- Cloud Discovery support for Cisco ASA logs has been improved for better visibility.
- You can now more easily run bulk actions and select multiple records in Cloud App Security portal tables: the page length has been increased to improve bulk operations.
- The **Outbound sharing by domain**, and **Owners of shared files** built-in reports can now be run for Salesforce data.
- We're starting rollout of additional Salesforce activities enabling you to track interesting information that was extracted from the activity data. These activities include viewing and editing accounts, leads, opportunities, and various other interesting Salesforce objects.
- New activities were added for Exchange to enable you to monitor which permissions were granted for user mailboxes or mailbox folders. These activities include:
  - Add recipient permissions
  - Remove recipient permissions
  - Add mailbox folder permissions
  - Remove mailbox folder permissions
  - Set mailbox folder permissions

   For example, you can now monitor users who were granted **SendAs** permissions to other users’ mailboxes and as a result can now send emails in their name.

### Cloud App Security release 95

Released April 24, 2017

**Updates:**

- The **Accounts** page has been updated with improvements that make detecting risks easier. You can now more easily filter for internal and external accounts. See at a glance whether a user has admin permissions. You can perform actions on each account per-app such as remove permissions, remove user’s collaborations, suspend user. Additionally, imported [user groups](user-groups.md) for each account will be displayed.

- For Microsoft work accounts (Office 365 and Azure Active Directory), Cloud App Security groups different user identifiers such as proxy addresses, aliases, SID, and more under a single account. All aliases related to an account will appear under the primary email address. Based on the list of user identifiers, for activities whose actor is a user identifier, the actor will be displayed as the primary user name UPN (User Principal Name). Based on the UPN, groups will be assigned and policies applied. This change will improve investigation of activities and fuse all related activities to the same session for anomalies and group-based policies. This feature will be gradually rolled out over the next month.

- The Robot tag was added as a possible risk factor in the Browser Use built-in report. Now, in addition to browser use being tagged as outdated, you can see when browser use was performed by a robot.
- When creating a content inspection file policy, you can now set the filter to include only files with at least 50 matches.

### Cloud App Security release 94

Released April 2, 2017

**New features:**

- Cloud App Security is now integrated with Azure RMS. You can protect files in Office 365 OneDrive and Sharepoint Online with Microsoft Rights Management directly from the Cloud App Security portal. Protection can be accomplished from the **Files** page. For more information, see [Integrating with Azure Information Protection](azip-integration.md). Support for additional applications will be available in future versions.
- Up until now, when robot and crawler activities take place on your network, it was especially hard to identify because the activities are not performed by a user on your network. Without your knowledge, bots and crawlers can run malicious tools on your computers. Now, Cloud App Security gives you the tools to see when robots and crawlers are performing activities on your network. You can use the new user agent tag to filter activities in the activity log. The user agent tag enables you to filter all activities performed by robots and you can use it to create a policy that alerts you each time this type of activity is detected. You'll be updated when future releases will include this risky activity as embedded into the anomaly detection alerts.
- The new unified app permissions page enables you to more easily investigate the permissions your users have given to third-party apps. By clicking on **Investigate** > **App permissions**, you can now view a list of all the permissions your users gave to third-party apps. A page of app permissions per connected app enables you to better compare between the various apps and the permissions granted. For more information, see [Manage app permissions](manage-app-permissions.md).
- You can filter data right from the table drawer for easier investigation.
In the **Activity log**, the **Files** table and **App permissions** pages are now enhanced with new contextual actions that makes pivoting in the investigation process a lot easier. We also added quick links to configuration pages and the ability to copy data with a single click. For more information, see the information about [working with the file and activity drawers](file-filters.md).
- Support for Microsoft Teams to Office 365 Activity logs and alerts rollout was completed.

### Cloud App Security release 93

Released March 20, 2017

**New features:**

- You can now apply policies to include or exclude imported user groups.
- Cloud App Security Anonymization now enables you to configure a custom encryption key. For more information, see [Cloud Discovery anonymization](cloud-discovery-anonymizer.md).
- In order to have more control over user and account management, you now have direct access to Azure AD account settings for each user and account from within the **Account** page. Just click the cog next to each user. This change enables easier access to advanced user management features group management, configuration of MFA, details about user sign-ins, and the ability to block sign-in.
- You can now export a blocking script for unsanctioned apps via the Cloud App Security API. Learn about our APIs in the Cloud App Security portal by clicking the question mark in the menu bar, followed by **API documentation**.
- The Cloud App Security app connector for ServiceNow was expanded to include support for OAuth tokens (as introduced in Geneva, Helsinki, Istanbul). This change provides a more robust API connection to ServiceNow that doesn't rely on the deploying user. For more information, see [Connect ServiceNow to Microsoft Cloud App Security](connect-servicenow-to-microsoft-cloud-app-security.md). Existing customers can update their settings in the ServiceNow App connector page.
- If you configured additional third-party DLP scanners, DLP scan status will now show the status of each connector independently to improve visibility.
- Cloud App Security now includes support for the Microsoft Teams activities that are supported in the Office 365 audit log. This feature is being rolled out gradually.
- For Exchange Online impersonation events, you can now filter by the permission level used - delegated, admin, or delegated admin. You can search for events displaying the impersonation level that interests you in the **Activity log** by searching for **Activity objects** > **Item**.
- In the app drawer on the **App Permissions** tab of Office 365 apps, you can now see the **Publisher** of each app. You can also use the Publisher as a filter for investigation of additional apps from the same publisher.
- Risky IP addresses now show up as an independent risk factor rather than weighted under the general **Location** risk factor.
- When Azure Information Protection labels are disabled on a file, the disabled labels will appear as disabled in Cloud App Security. Deleted labels won't be displayed.

**Additional Salesforce support:**

- You can now suspend and unsuspend Salesforce users in Cloud App Security. This action can be accomplished in the **Accounts** tab of the Salesforce Connector. Click the cog at the end of the row of a specific user and select**Suspend** or **Unsuspend**. Suspend and unsuspend can also be applied as a governance action as part of a policy. All suspend and unsuspend activities taken in Cloud App Security will be logged in the [Governance log](governance-actions.md).
- Improved visibility to Salesforce content sharing: You can now see which files were shared with whom, including publicly shared files, files shared with groups, and files shared with the entire Salesforce domain. Improved visibility will be rolled out retroactively to new and current connected Salesforce apps, it may take a while for this information to update the first time.
- We improved coverage for the following Salesforce events, and separated them out of the **Manage users** activity:
  - Edit permissions
  - Create user
  - Change role
  - Reset password

### Cloud App Security release 90, 91, 92

Released February  2017

**Special announcement:**

Cloud App Security is now officially certified with Microsoft Compliance for ISO, HIPAA, CSA STAR, EU model clauses, and more. See the full list of certifications in the [Microsoft Compliance Offerings](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/compliance/complianceofferings) article by selecting Cloud App Security.

**New features:**

- **Import user groups (preview)**   When you connect apps using API connectors, Cloud App Security now enables you to import user groups, from Office 365 and Azure Active Directory. Typical scenarios that leverage imported user groups include: investigating which docs the HR people look at, or you can check if there's something unusual happening in the executive group, or if someone from the admin group performed an activity outside the US. For details and instructions, see [Importing user groups](user-groups.md).

- In the Activity log, you can now filter users and users in groups to show which activities were performed by a specific user, and which were performed on a specific user. For example, you can investigate activities in which the user impersonated others, and activities in which others impersonated this user. For more information, see [Activities](activity-filters.md).

- When investigating a file in the **Files** page, if you drill down into the **Collaborators** of a specific file, you can now see more information about the collaborators. This information includes if they're Internal or External, Writers or Readers (file permissions), and when a file is shared with a group you can now see all users who are members of the group. Seeing all users enables you to see if the group members are external users.

- IPv6 support is now available for all appliances.

- Cloud Discovery now supports Barracuda appliances.

- Cloud App Security system alerts now cover SIEM connectivity errors. For more information, see [SIEM integration](siem.md).

### Cloud App Security release 89

Released January 22, 2017

**New features:**

- We're starting to roll out the ability to view Office 365 Security and Compliance Center DLP events in Cloud App Security. If you configured DLP policies in the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center, when policy matches are detected, you'll see them in the Cloud App Security Activity log. The information in the Activity log will include the file or email that triggered the match as and the policy or alert that it matched. The **Security event** activity allows you to view Office 365 DLP policy matches in the Cloud App Security activity log. Using this feature, you can:
  - See all DLP matches coming from the Office 365 DLP engine.

### Cloud App Security release 85

Released November 27, 2016

**New features:**

- A distinction was made between sanctioned apps and connected apps. Sanctioning and unsanctioning is now a tag that can be applied to discovered apps and any app in the app catalog. Connected apps are apps that you connected using the API connector for deeper visibility and control. You can now tag apps as sanctioned or unsanctioned or connect them using the app connector, where available.
